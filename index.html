            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Web development is difficult to learn, especially when you're first getting started. Itâ€™s easy to get
                stuck on a problem and end up quitting. Many people go through this cycle several times before they can
                harness the motivation to see it through to the end. Even more people never get that far.</p>
